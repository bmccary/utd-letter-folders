# What is This?

I made [this PDF](https://bmccary.github.io/utd-letter-folders/letter.pdf) because collecting and returning student papers is a bit of a hassle.

1. When grading/recording student papers, one of the steps is sorting them by name. It is convenient to have students turn in their papers into *bins* by last name so that their papers are already partially-sorted.
2. When returning students papers, it is convenient for them to be able to form multiple *lines* by last name and service themselves.

Over the course of time, I have found that `N = 8` is about right for the number of *bins*, and this PDF has 8 pages with letters of the alphabet on them.
I cut them out and tape them to folders. 

# Usage

You can probably just print [the PDF](https://bmccary.github.io/utd-letter-folders/letter.pdf).

But if you want to customize it then change to a suitable directory, and

```
git clone https://github.com/bmccary/utd-letter-folders.git
cd utd-letter-folders
make
```
